    Service fails or suffers
    service interruption during use. You agree that you will be

    responsible
    for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, hold harmless, and

    indemnify
    i911, its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries
    and

    agents and the i911 Entities from and against every claim, liability,
    damage, loss, and

    expense, including reasonable attorneys'' fees and costs,
    arising out of or in any way

    connected with: (a) your access to, use of,
    or alleged use of, the Service; (b) your

    violation of any portion of these
    Terms, any representation, warranty, or agreement

    referenced in these Terms,
    or any applicable law or regulation; (c) your violation of any

    third-party
    right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality,
    other

    property, or privacy right; or (d) any dispute or issue between you
    and any third party.

    We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume
    the exclusive defense and control

    of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification
    by you (without limiting your

    indemnification obligations with respect to
    that matter), and in that case, you agree to

    cooperate with our defense

    HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO
    NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE

    ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.


    SOME JURISDICTIONS
    MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND

    YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT
    VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO

    JURISDICTION, BUT BY USING THIS SERVICE AND AGREEING
    TO THE TERMS

    OF i911''S PRODUCT, YOU WAIVE THOSE RIGHTS AND ACCEPT THAT
    NO

    WARRANTIES ARE MADE RELATING TO THE USE OF i911.

    THE SERVICE, YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE

    CLAIMS IN ANY OTHER COURT OF
    LAW. VENUE AND JURISDICTION WILL BE IN

    THE STATE OF DELAWARE.


    14.
    Governing Law


    These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware
    without regard to

    conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding
    is permitted under these

    Terms, you and i911 agree to submit to the personal
    and exclusive jurisdiction in the

    state of Delaware, for the purpose of
    litigating any dispute. Choice of venue and

    governing law shall have no
    impact on whether, or create any representation that, the

    Service is appropriate
    or available for use in said jurisdiction.



    15. General


    These Terms,
    together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly

    incorporated
    by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding

    and
    agreement between you and i911 regarding your use of the Service. You may not

    assign
    or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part,
    by

    operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We
    may assign these

    Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure
    to require performance of any

    provision will not affect our right to require
    performance at any other time after that, nor

    will a waiver by us of any
    breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these

    Terms, be a
    waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision

    itself.
    Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have

    any
    impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is
    held to be

    invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given
    effect to the greatest

    extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain
    in full force and effect. Upon

    termination of these Terms, any provision
    that by its nature or express terms should

    survive, will survive, including
    Sections 2, 4, and 5 through 18.

  m_text: '16. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration


    16.1 Generally. In the interest
    of resolving disputes between you and i911 in the most

    expedient and cost
    effective manner, you and i911 agree that every dispute arising in

    connection
    with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a

    neutral
    arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than
    in

    court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
    can award the

    same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement
    to arbitrate disputes

    includes all claims arising out of or relating to
    any aspect of these Terms, whether

    based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
    misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and

    regardless of whether
    a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.

    YOU UNDERSTAND
    AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU

    AND i911 ARE EACH WAIVING
    THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO

    PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.


    16.2
    Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, we both agree that nothing
    in

    these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the
    right of either of

    us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims
    court; (b) pursue an enforcement

    action through the applicable federal,
    state, or local agency if that action is available; (c)

    seek injunctive
    relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an

    intellectual
    property infringement claim.


    16.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you
    and i911 will be governed by the

    Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures
    and the Supplementary Procedures for

    Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,
    "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration

    Association ("AAA"), as modified
    by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.

    The AAA Rules and filing
    forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA

    at 1-800-778-7879.


    16.4
    Notice Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written

    notice
    of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature

    required),
    or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail

    ("Notice").
    i911''s address for Notice is: 500 Oleander Drive, Hallandale Beach, Florida

    33009.
    The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and

    (b)
    set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts
    to

    resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do
    so within 30 days

    after the Notice is received, you or i911 may commence
    an arbitration proceeding.

    During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
    offer made by you or i911 must not

    be disclosed to the arbitrator until
    after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award,

    if any. If our dispute
    is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, i911 will pay you

    the
    highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii)
    the last

    written settlement amount offered by i911 in settlement of the
    dispute prior to the

    arbitrator''s award; or (iii) $1,000.


    16.5 Fees.
    If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, i911 will

    reimburse
    you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than

    $10,000,
    in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.

    Any
    arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in jurisdiction
    of

    Delaware, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether
    the arbitration

    will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents
    submitted to the arbitrator; (b)

    through a non-appearance based telephone
    hearing; or (c) by an inperson hearing as

    established by the AAA Rules in
    the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the

    arbitrator finds
    that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand

    is
    frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
    forth

    in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
    fees will be governed

    by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse
    i911 for all monies previously

    disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation
    to pay under the AAA Rules.

    Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
    is conducted, the arbitrator must issue

    a reasoned written decision sufficient
    to explain the essential findings and conclusions

    on which the decision
    and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings

    and resolve
    disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any

    time
    during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days
    of

    the arbitrator''s ruling on the merits.


    16.6 No Class Actions.
    YOU AND i911 AGREE THAT, BASED ON THE

    STIPULATIONS AND TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
    EACH MAY BRING

    QUALIFYING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL
    CAPACITY

    AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR

    REPRESENTATIVE
    PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and i911 agree

    otherwise, the arbitrator
    may not consolidate more than one person or entity''s claims

    and may not
    otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.


    16.7
    Modifications. If i911 makes any future change to this arbitration provision
    (other

    than a change to i911''s address for Notice), you may reject the
    change by sending us

    written notice within 30 days of the change to i911''s
    address for Notice, in which case

    your account with i911 will be immediately
    terminated and this arbitration provision, as

    in effect immediately prior
    to the amendments you reject will survive.


    16.8 Enforceability. If Section
    16.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this

    Section 16
    is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 will be null

    and
    void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and
    venue

    described in Section 14 will govern any action arising out of or related
    to these Terms.

    makes available the i911 Service to Emergency Service Providers. \"Emergency\r\nService
    Provider\" or \"User\" includes any safety or emergency response provider\r\nincluding
    law enforcement, fire, police, coast guard, emergency medical, emergency\r\nmanagement,
    campus safety officials, or public health services, whether a municipal,\r\nlocal,
    state, federal, or military, government agency, who uses i911/the Service to\r\nreceive
    information in order to facilitate the provision of safety or emergency services,\r\nincluding
    but not limited to utilizing the Service to send emergency and general\r\ninterest
    notifications and updates to Subscribers and other Users.\r\nThe Emergency Service
    Providers may authorize their employees or other individuals\r\nto use i911 Services.
    This Privacy Notice does not apply to the privacy practices of\r\nany Emergency
    Service Provider.\r\nA \"Subscriber\" is any individual member of the general
    public who utilizes the i911\r\napplication (mobile website) or the Service to
    receive assistance during an emergency\r\nresponse. Anyone who uses the Service
    to communicate with, or receive\r\ncommunications from, Emergency Service Providers
    or Users is a Subscriber.\r\nSubscribers should only provide the information
    you want Emergency Service\r\nProviders, or Users, to have access to.\r\nSubscribers
    understand and agree that once the content of your account is made\r\navailable
    to Emergency Service Providers, it may be transmitted over unsecured\r\nEmergency
    Service Provider radios or may otherwise be made accessible through\r\nunsecured
    communications as part of the information disseminated to or by\r\nEmergency
    Service Providers responding to a 9-1-1 call or to an emergency.\r\nIf you are
    a Subscriber, you understand and agree and hereby authorize i911 to\r\nrelease
    and disclose your account information to Emergency Service Providers and\r\nUsers
    in connection with the Service.\r\n\n2. Personal Information We Collect\r\n\nIn
    connection with your use of the public portions of our website or the i911 Services:\r\n\n\u2022
    You may submit information to us directly;\r\n\u2022 We may obtain information
    about you from Emergency Service Providers, or Users, or\r\ntheir employees;\r\n\u2022
    We or our service providers may use automated means to collect certain information\r\nabout
    your use of our website or the i911 Service.\r\nWhen you use the i911 Service,
    you may provide and we may collect what is generally\r\ncalled personally identifiable
    information, or personal information, which is information\r\nthat specifically
    identifies an individual. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we\r\nrefer
    to such information as \"Personal Information.\" Examples of Personal Information\r\ninclude
    name, email address, mailing address, and mobile phone number. Personal\r\nInformation
    also includes other information, such as date of birth, geographic area, or\r\npreferences,
    when any such information is linked to information that identifies a\r\nspecific
    individual. You may provide us with Personal Information in various ways on\r\nthe
    i911 Service. For example, you provide us with Personal Information when you\r\nregister
    for an account, use the i911 Service, or send us customer service-related\r\nrequests.
    Personal Information will also include any information about other adults or\r\nchildren
    (for whom you must have appropriate legal responsibility or appropriate prior\r\nconsent)
    that you enter into the i911 Service. Personal Information will also include\r\nany
    health-related information about yourself or others that you enter into or provide
    to\r\nthe i911 Service. You are not required to provide any health-related information
    in\r\norder to use the i911 Service, but if you do, that Personal Information
    will be subject to\r\nthis Privacy Policy.\r\nWe do not collect, nor do we knowingly
    permit third parties to collect, personal\r\ninformation about your activities
    over time and across third-party websites or online\r\nservices.\r\nWhen you
    use the Service, we collect geo-location information from your device to\r\ndetermine
    your physical location.\r\nWhen you use the Service, we may send one or more
    cookies - small text files\r\ncontaining a string of alphanumeric characters
    - to your device. We may use both\r\nsession cookies and persistent cookies.
    A session cookie disappears after you close\r\nyour browser. A persistent cookie
    remains after you close your browser and may be\r\nused by your browser on subsequent
    visits to the Service. Please review your web\r\nbrowser \"Help\" file to learn
    the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note\r\nthat if you delete,
    or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be\r\nable to
    utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.\r\nWe may also
    automatically record certain information from your device by using\r\nvarious
    types of technology, including \"clear gifs\" or \"web beacons.\" This\r\nautomatically
    collected information may include your IP address or other device\r\naddress
    or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit\r\njust
    before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view
    or\r\notherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you
    visit, access,\r\nor use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect
    information\r\nregarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether
    you opened, clicked\r\non, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered
    from all users, and may be\r\nconnected with your Personal Information.\r\nWe
    may also implement third-party content on the Service that may use clear gifs
    or\r\nother forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider
    to read and\r\nwrite cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing
    of the third party content\r\non the Service. Additionally, we may implement
    third party buttons (such as Facebook\r\n\"like\" or \"share\" buttons) that
    may allow third parties to collect information about you\r\nthrough such third
    parties' browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the\r\nbutton. Information
    collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by\r\nthese third
    parties, and i911 does not participate in that data transmission. Information\r\ncollected
    by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party's own data\r\ncollection,
    use, and disclosure policies.\r\nWe may obtain information, including Personal
    Information, from third parties and\r\nsources other than the Service, such as
    our Emergency Service Provider partners. If\r\nwe combine or associate information
    from other sources with Personal Information\r\nthat we collect through the Service,

  m_text: '7. Operating i911 Abroad


    The i911 Service is hosted in the United
    States and is intended for visitors located

    within the United States. If
    you choose to use the Service from the European Union or

    other regions of
    the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ

    from
    U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your Personal Information

    outside
    of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we

    may
    transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection
    with

    storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating
    the Service. By

    providing any information, including Personal Information,
    on or to the Service, you

    consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.

    An
    Emergency Service Provider may choose to use i911 Services outside of the

    United
    States, for example in the course of an international emergency response.

    While
    operating i911 outside of the United States, we may transfer personal

    information
    that we collect in a foreign country back to Emergency Service Providers,

    affiliates,
    service providers, and other third parties in the United States, unless

    otherwise
    directed by the Emergency Service Provider.


    8. How We Protect Personal
    Information/Data Security


    i911 maintains administrative, technical and
    physical safeguards designed to protect

    the personal information we maintain
    against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized

    destruction, loss, alteration,
    access, disclosure or use. However, we cannot guarantee

    that the measures
    we maintain will guarantee the security of the personal information.

    Any
    transmission of personal information to us is completed at your own risk. We
    also

    cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed,
    altered, or

    destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial
    safeguards.

    Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to
    limit access to certain

    Personal Information, please be aware that no security
    measures are perfect or

    impenetrable. We are not responsible for circumvention
    of any privacy settings or

    security measures on the Service. Additionally,
    we cannot control the actions of other

    Subscribers with whom you may choose
    to share your information. Further, even after

    information posted on the
    Service is removed, caching and archiving services may

    have saved that information,
    and other users or third parties may have copied or

    stored the information
    available on the Service. We cannot and do not guarantee that

    information
    you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized

    persons.

    first

    responders and military, regarding safety, emergency response services,

    as a Subscriber, Emergency

    Service Provider or User.


    2. Eligibility


    Users
    must be at least thirteen (13) years of age to use the Service. By agreeing to

    these
    Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least thirteen (13)

    years
    of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service;

    and
    (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable

    laws
    and regulations. If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, organization,
    or

    company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind
    that

    organization or company to these Terms and you agree to be bound by
    these Terms on

    behalf of that organization.


    3. Accounts and Registration


    3.1
    To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When

    you
    register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information

    about
    yourself, such as your government e-mail address, phone numbers or other

    contact
    information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and

    that
    you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. Your account information
    will

    also include any other information (which may include personally identifiable

    information
    or health-related information) that you provide to the Service. When you

    register,
    you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for

    maintaining
    the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept

    responsibility
    for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to

    believe
    that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at

    hello@i911.com.


    3.2
    You understand and accept full legal responsibility for the content, accuracy,
    and

    sufficiency of all information that you include or do not include as
    part of your account.

    All information within your account is subject to
    the i911 Privacy Policy.


    3.3 By creating an account, you agree that i911
    may contact you to validate the phone

    number(s) you register with your account.
    You also agree that if another individual

    registers and validates a phone
    number that you had previously registered, the phone

    number will be removed
    from your account and assigned to the other individual.


    3.4 You must confirm,
